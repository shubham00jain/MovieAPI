# MovieAPI
This is an API which is used to search about all the movies present in the database of IMDB. This API uses the API of OMDB in the backend.

Steps to run this application:
1. Clone the code using `git clone [url]`
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`. (You might need to install npm first.)
3. Run the server using `node server.js`.
4. Fire up a browser and enter the url `localhost:3000` to visit the website.

Or Visit https://movie-search-webapi.herokuapp.com/search. (This might stop working in the future beacuse I use unpaid version of heroku.)
